This plugin gives you the capability to mark up your files as if you had a highlighter.

It's a really useful aid for inspecting log files and marking important sections in source code and documents (even vim help files).

The highlights are remembered, even after you close the file. You can also distribute the marks so others can see the highlights you've made.

There are a number of different highlighters available for use. (NOTE: you will probably want to create mappings for these commands)
:WordHighlighter
Highlight the word under the cursor

:SelectionHighlighter
Highlight the current selection. A visual mapping for this command is recommended.

:SearchPatternHighlighter
Highlight the current search pattern.

:ClearAllHighlighters
Clear all highlights made in this file.

:ClearCurrentHighligher
Clear the Highlighter under the cursor

:ConfigureHighlighter
Open the configure window. From here you can configure how the highlighter colors are determined - randomized, use a favorite color, etc.

Look under Plugin->Highlighter for more options.

The highlighter only works with gvim and 'syntax' must be on.  Also, the terminal must support vim colors in the format #rrggbb.

Comments/suggestions/complaints are gladly taken.
